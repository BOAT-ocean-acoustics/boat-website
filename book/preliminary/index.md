# What to Expect 

## Workshop format

We believe in learning by doing and sharing, and design the BOAT workshop to be highly interactive with hands-on tutorials and exercises with real-world data to encourage exchanges and collaboration between workshop participants.


## Computing environment

All workshop tutorials and exercises will be in a browser-based [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) computing environment via [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We will provide a quick walk through in he beginning of the workshop to make sure everyone knows how to navigate this environment and look for help. If you are interested in trying this out beforehand, [follow this page to try Jupyter on your browser](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html).

<!-- If you are interested in installing Jupyter on your own machine, checkout this page -->


## Programming experience

All executable workshop materials will be written in Python. Therefore, we expect participants to have some experience with scripting programming languages, such as Python, Matlab, and R. If you are not familiar with Python, check out the Software Carpentry [core lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/#core-lessons-in-english): 
- [Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)
- [Plotting and programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/)

The focus of the workshop will be on ocean acoustics, and the goal of the executable tutorials is to ensure theoretical concepts are introduced alongside hands-on implementations for participants to develop physical intuitions behind the equations. 

Due to the short timespan of the workshop,  If you are interested in learning more useful Python packages, checkout Project Pythia [Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html).
